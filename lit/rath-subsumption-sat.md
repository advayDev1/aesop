# Jakob Rath et al., First-Order Subsumption via SAT Solving

<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10026558>

## Overview

This paper describes an encoding of clause subsumption as a SAT problem.
Given this encoding, a specialised SAT solver can be used to decide subsumption more quickly than the previous Vampire implementation.

This is probably too complex for us, but we can maybe name-check it as related work.
