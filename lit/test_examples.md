## Ganesalingam and Gowers

- Let $f : X \to Y$ and $U$ be an open subset of $Y$, then $f^{-1}(U)$ is an open subset of $X$,
- Let $f: X \to Y$ be an injection and $A, B$ be subset of $X$, then $f(A)\cap f(B) \subset f(A\cap B)$.
- Let $G$ be a group and let $S$ be a subset of $G$ with the property that if $x ∈ S$ and $y ∈ S$, then $xy^{−1} ∈ S$. Prove that $S$ is closed under taking inverses.
- Let $X$ be a complete metric space and let $A$ be a closed subset of $X$. Prove that $A$ is complete.
- Let $A$ and $B$ be open subsets of a metric space $X$. Prove that $A \cap B$ is open.

## Zhan (Auto 2)

- Let $p$ be a prime number such that $p>2$, then $p$ is odd.
- Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then there exists a prime $p$ such that $n < p$.
